SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here flutter build apk --release
SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here flutter build ios --release
SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here flutter build web --release
```

### Sentry Configuration

All production builds include:

- **Error tracking** with Sentry DSN
- **Code obfuscation** for security
- **Debug symbols** upload for crash symbolication

Make sure to:

1. Set your `SENTRY_DSN` from your Sentry project
2. Upload debug symbols to Sentry after each release for proper stack traces
3. Keep `build/debug-info/` directory for symbolication
